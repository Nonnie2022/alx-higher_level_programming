Requirements
Python Scripts
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
A README.md file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project, is mandatory
Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
All your files must be executable
The length of your files will be tested using wc

Shell Scripts
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
All your scripts should be exactly two lines long (wc -l file should print 2)
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/bin/bash
All your files must be executable
C Scripts
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
All your files should end with a new line
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
You are not allowed to use global variables
No more than 5 functions per file
In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called lists.h
Don’t forget to push your header file
All your header files should be include guarded


TASKS 
=====0===== Run Python file

Write a Shell script that runs a Python script.

The Python file name will be saved in the environment variable $PYFILE

guillaume@ubuntu:~/py/0x00$ cat main.py 
#!/usr/bin/python3
print("Best School")

guillaume@ubuntu:~/py/0x00$ export PYFILE=main.py
guillaume@ubuntu:~/py/0x00$ ./0-run
Best School
guillaume@ubuntu:~/py/0x00$ 
Repo:

GitHub repository: alx-higher_level_programming
Directory: 0x00-python-hello_world
File: 0-run

=====1===== Run inline

Write a Shell script that runs Python code.

The Python code will be saved in the environment variable $PYCODE

guillaume@ubuntu:~/py/0x00$ export PYCODE='print(f"Best School: {88+10}")'
guillaume@ubuntu:~/py/0x00$ ./1-run_inline 
Best School: 98

Directory: 0x00-python-hello_world
File: 1-run_inline

=====2===== Hello, print

Write a Python script that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line.

Use the function print
guillaume@ubuntu:~/py/0x00$ ./2-print.py 
"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle
